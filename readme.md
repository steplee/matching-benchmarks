# Matching Benchmarks
I wanted to benchmark different strategies for matching two sets of points, in this case jsut by distance. The classes' names include 'grid' because I was going to benchmark ways of assinging points to grid cells first.
Instead I started with the naive O(nn) matching. I think for moderate sizes this should be faster on the GPU, but the grid is probably faster for all but tiny sizes on the CPU.

So far I have:
  - CpuNaive: simple O(nn) matching
  - CpuNaiveMultithreaded: slice first point set into N groups and assign N threads the work. Actually I use 'tasks' in the C++11 terminology.
  - CudaNaive: The file contains 3 different kernels and 3 different approaches.
      1. First is each item in first point set gets its own thread and has a `N` loop over each second item. This is simple in that there is no contention amongst threads if it's okay for the matching to be injective.
      2. Each pair gets its own thread. Faster as `N` grows. Not always correct, if there is contention it could be wrong. Injectivity still not handled.
      3. Each pair gets its own thread, each A point has it's own `distThresh`, which is atomically read/written and ensures matching distance is always decreasing. Initializes `distThresh` to a default as other methods do.
      4. (*TODO*) Method (3), plus another array to prevent cross-matching and handle injectivity.
